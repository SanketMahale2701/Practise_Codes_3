                            Generic Data-Structure liabrary  (02 : 55 min)

1. This project is developed using C++ programming.
   This project contains all the implimentations of the functions from almost all data-structures.
   
2. As This liabrary contains the functions which are implimentated in generic manner we can 
   use that functions with any type of data type.This liabrary is helpful for the application 
   programmer how needs the implimentations of data structures in its application or project.

3. In this project we provide the implimentations of singly linear linklist, Singly circular linklist,
   Doubly linear linklist, Doubly circular linklist, Stack, Queue, Binary search tree, etc.

4. For all this data structures we also provide some custome functionalitities which are not avalable 
   in any inbuilt liabrary (Standard template liabrary, Collections).
